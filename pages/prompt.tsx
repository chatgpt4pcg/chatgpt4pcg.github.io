						{`Use \`ab_drop()\` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the &lt;OBJECT&gt;â€”the goal. Dropping position and order are crucial.

1. Definitions
Slots: The map's width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map's height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.

2. Environment
There are three block types as follows:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

3. Tool
Use the \`ab_drop()\` function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.`}

					<SectionHeader>Prompt Rules</SectionHeader>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Prompts must be written in English using only alphanumeric
							characters and the following symbols: ~, /, \, +, -, *, `, &#39;,
							&quot;, ., ,, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, (, ), _, =, [, ], {'{'},{' '}
							{'}'}, |, &lt;, and &gt;.
						</li>
						<li>
							The maximum word count for a prompt is <strong>900 words</strong>.
							The number of words will be counted by our tool which has the same
							algorithm as the online version provided on the{' '}
							<Link href='/resources'>Resources</Link> page.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prompts must be designed for a one-round dialogue, meaning that
							there should be only one user request (the prompt) and one
							response from ChatGPT. This ensures simplicity and fairness in
							this year&apos;s competition.
						</li>
						<li>
							Prompts exceeding this limit or containing disallowed characters
							will result in automatic disqualification.
						</li>
						<li>
							Responses from the ChatGPT API must contain code blocks indicated
							by the presence of three backticks (```) in the output.
							<ol>
								<li>
									The <em>code extraction script</em> will only extract the
									content between the last pair of three backticks (```).
								</li>
								<li>
									The extracted code must not contain any loops. Any use of
									loops will be ignored, resulting in only one instance of the
									loop&apos;s content. The code should not use variables in the
									call of <code>ab_drop()</code> function, as this will result
									in an error and that response will be skipped for the rest of
									the evaluation process. To check the behavior of the code
									extractor, please refer to the{' '}
									<Link href='/resources'>Resources</Link> page where you can
									find an online tool for this task.
								</li>
								<li>
									If no code blocks are present or extracted code results in an
									empty string, the response will be skipped, and its score will
									be 0.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							A prompt must include <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> to indicate a
							section of the prompt that will be replaced by us with each target
							character, such as &quot;I&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, or &quot;U&quot;.
							Prompts without <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> will not be assessed.
						</li>
						<li>
							The response to your prompt from ChatGPT must explicitly include a
							series of <code>ab_drop()</code> , which will be executed in that
							order by our tool to generate a character-like structure in a
							Science Birds level.
						</li>
						<li>
							The definition of the <code>ab_drop()</code> function is as
							follows:
							<ol>
								<li>
									It drops a block vertically from the top so that its center is
									located at slot <code>x_position</code>.
								</li>
								<li>
									This function works on the following settings:
									<ol>
										<li>
											A character is placed on a 2D grid with a width (
											<code>W</code>) of 20 columns and a height (<code>H</code>
											) of 16 rows. The grid is formed by 320 equal-size cells.
										</li>
										<li>
											Coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> are used to represent the
											positions in the grid, where <code>x</code> and{' '}
											<code>y</code> show the horizontal and vertical indices of
											cells, respectively. For example, <code>(0, 0)</code>{' '}
											denotes the bottom-left corner cell of the grid, and{' '}
											<code>(W-1, H-1)</code> is the top-right corner cell.
										</li>
										<li>
											A cell on the grid has a size of 1x1. Each cell has unique{' '}
											<code>(x, y)</code> coordinates associated with it.
										</li>
									</ol>
								</li>
								<li>
									It has two parameters:
									<ol>
										<li>
											<code>block_type</code>: a value that indicates the type
											of block to be placed. The possible values are
											<code>b11</code>, <code>b13</code>, and <code>b31</code>.
											An invalid block type will result in an error.
											<ol>
												<li>
													<code>b11</code> denotes a square block whose size is
													1x1.
													<Image
														src='b11.png'
														alt='b11 blocks'
														noBorderRadius
														width={24}
													/>
												</li>
												<li>
													<code>b13</code> denotes a column block whose size is
													1x3.
													<Image
														src='b13.png'
														alt='b13 blocks'
														noBorderRadius
														width={24}
													/>
												</li>
												<li>
													<code>b31</code> denotes a row block whose size is
													3x1.
													<Image
														src='b31.png'
														alt='b31 blocks'
														noBorderRadius
														width={24 * 3}
													/>
												</li>
											</ol>
										</li>
										<li>
											<code>x_position</code>: a horizontal index of a grid
											cell, where <code>0</code> represents the leftmost column
											of the grid, and <code>W-1</code> represents the rightmost
											column of the grid. The <code>x_position</code> parameter
											indicates the center pivot point of the block being
											placed. For example, if <code>b31</code> is the only block
											in the level and is placed at <code>x_position=4</code>,
											it will occupy cells <code>(3, 0)</code>,{' '}
											<code>(4, 0)</code>, and <code>(5, 0)</code>. An invalid
											position, like a position where a block of interest
											intrudes on the grid boundary, will result in an error.
