						{`Use \`ab_drop()\` function to generate a stable structure that looks like the &lt;OBJECT&gt;â€”the goal. Dropping position and order are crucial.

1. Definitions
Slots: The map's width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map's height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.

2. Environment
There are three block types as follows:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

3. Tool
Use the \`ab_drop()\` function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.`}

					<SectionHeader>Prompt Rules</SectionHeader>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								The prompt must be written in English using only alphanumeric
								characters and the following symbols: /, , +, -, *, `, &#39;,
								&quot;, ., ,, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &amp;, (, ), _, =, [, ], {'{'},{' '}
								{'}'}, |, &lt;, and &gt;.
							</Paragraph>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								The maximum word count for the prompt is{' '}
								<strong>900 words</strong>. The number of words will be counted
								by our tool which has the same algorithm as the online version
								provided on the <Link href='/resources'>Resource</Link> page.
							</Paragraph>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								Prompts exceeding this limit or containing disallowed characters
								will result in automatic disqualification.
							</Paragraph>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								Responses from the ChatGPT API must contain code blocks
								indicated by the presence of three backticks (```) in the
								output. If no code blocks are present, the response will be
								skipped, and its score will be 0.
							</Paragraph>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								The prompt must include <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> to indicate
								a section of the prompt that will be replaced with each target
								character, such as &quot;A,&quot; &quot;B,&quot; or
								&quot;X.&quot; Prompts without <code>&lt;OBJECT&gt;</code> will
								not be assessed.
							</Paragraph>
						</li>
						<li>
							<Paragraph>
								The response to your prompt from ChatGPT must explicitly include
								a series of <code>ab_drop()</code> , which will be executed in
								that order by our tool to generate a character-like structure in
								a Science Birds level.

								The definition of the <code>ab_drop()</code> function is as
								follows:
							</Paragraph>
							<ol>
								<li>
									<Paragraph>
										It drops a block vertically from the top so that its center
										is located at slot <code>x_position</code>.

											<Paragraph>
												A 2D grid with equal cell size and a width (
												<code>W</code>) of 20 cells and a height (<code>H</code>
												) of 16 cells is a two-dimensional arrangement of
												rectangular cells, each of which has the same size and
												dimensions.
											</Paragraph>
										</li>
										<li>
											<Paragraph>
												A coordinate <code>(x, y)</code> where <code>x</code>{' '}
												represents the horizontal index and <code>y</code>{' '}
												represents the vertical index. <code>(0, 0)</code>
												denotes the bottom-left corner cell of the grid and
												<code>(W-1, H-1)</code> denotes the top-right corner
												cell of the grid.
											</Paragraph>
										</li>
										<li>
											<Paragraph>
												A cell on the grid has a size of 1x1 cell. Each cell has
												a unique <code>(x, y)</code> coordinate associated with

												<code>b11</code>, <code>b13</code>, and <code>b31</code>
												. An invalid block type will result in an error.

												<code>x_position</code>: a horizontal index of a grid
												cell, where <code>0</code> represents the leftmost cell
												of the grid, and <code>W-1</code> represents the
												rightmost cell of the grid. The <code>x_position</code>{' '}
												parameter indicates the center pivot point of the block
												being placed. For example, if <code>b31</code> is the
												only block in the level and is placed at{' '}
												<code>x_position=4</code>, it will occupy cells{' '}
												<code>(3, 0)</code>, <code>(4, 0)</code>, and{' '}
