## Description of the Competition

The 1st ChatGPT4PCG Competition challenges participants to utilize the state-of-the-art natural language processing tool, ChatGPT, to generate visually appealing and structurally sound levels for Science Birds, an Angry Birds clone created for research purposes.

As a participant, your goal is to create a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to generate a level in Science Birds that resembles an English character while ensuring that the level is stable and able to withstand gravity. You are encouraged to use various prompt engineering techniques to develop the most effective prompt possible.

To participate, you must submit your prompt along with instructions on how to generate various character levels. We will then generate a number of samples, each of which will undergo rigorous testing for stability and similarity. Stability will be evaluated by loading the level in Science Birds and ensuring that there is no movement for a duration of 10 seconds. The similarity of each generated level to its corresponding English character will be determined using a state-of-the-art optical character recognition (OCR) model.

This competition offers a unique opportunity for the best prompt engineers from around the world to showcase their creativity and skills. Join us in this exciting challenge to push the boundaries of natural language processing and procedural content generation!
