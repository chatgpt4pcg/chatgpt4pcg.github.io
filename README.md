The 2nd ChatGPT4PCG Competition challenges participants to utilize the state-of-the-art natural language processing tool, ChatGPT, to generate visually appealing and structurally sound levels for Science Birds, an Angry Birds clone created for research purposes.
As a participant, your goal is to create a prompt that instructs ChatGPT to generate a level in Science Birds that resembles an English capital letter while ensuring that the level is stable and able to withstand gravity. You are encouraged to use various prompt engineering techniques to develop the most effective prompt possible.

To participate, you must submit your prompt according to our guidelines. We will then generate a number of samples, each of which will undergo rigorous testing for stability and similarity. Stability will be evaluated by loading the level in Science Birds and examining the ratio of unmoved blocks after 10 seconds of the initialization. The similarity of each generated level to its corresponding English character will be determined using an open-source Vision Transformer (ViT)-based classifier model. The stability testing system and the instructions to use the classifier model, as well as all the relevant tools, will be provided.

This competition offers a unique opportunity for the best prompt engineers from around the world to showcase their creativity and skills. Join us in this exciting challenge to push the boundaries of prompt engineering and procedural content generation!

## Submission deadline

Midterm: 19 May 2023 (23:59 JST)

Final: **29 July 2023** ~~21 July 2023~~ (23:59 JST)

If OpenAI releases an update to free-version web-based ChatGPT one week before the deadline (either for the midterm or final), we will extend the deadline by one week to give participants enough time to adjust their prompts. We will notify all participants who have submitted their work by email if this occurs. We will also make an announcement on our website.

Midterm submission is optional, although we recommend it. Any team that submits during the mid-term submission will be notified of the preliminary results. However, all teams, whether they submit during the midterm or not, must submit during the final submission period. Only submissions during the final submission period will be considered for the final ranking.
