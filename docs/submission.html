1. Definitions
Slots: The map&#x27;s width is equally partitioned into W slots where W = 20, with slots 0 and 19 being the most left and right, respectively.
Layers: The map&#x27;s height is equally partitioned into H layers where H = 16, with layers 0 and 15 being the bottom and top layers, respectively.
Base: The bottom of the map, i.e., layer 0.

2. Environment
There are three block types as follows:
b11, a square block whose width is 1 unit and height is 1 unit
b31, a horizontal block whose width is 3 units and height is 1 unit
b13, a vertical block whose width is 1 unit and height is 3 units

3. Tool
Use the `ab_drop()` function to vertically drop a block from layer H such that its center is at slot y and drop earlier blocks representing more bottom parts of the structure.</code></pre></div><p class="Paragraph_paragraph__zpRpR">If you have any questions, please contact us at this<!-- --> <a href="mailto:chatgpt4pcg@gmail.com">email address</a>.</p></section><section class="Section_section__8c_zV"><h2 class="SectionHeader_sectionHeader__ntehe">Submission Deadline</h2><p class="Paragraph_paragraph__zpRpR">Midterm: 19 May 2023 (23:59 JST)</p><p class="Paragraph_paragraph__zpRpR">Final: 21 July 2023 (23:59 JST)</p><p class="Paragraph_paragraph__zpRpR">If OpenAI releases an update to free-version web-based ChatGPT one week before the deadline (either for the midterm or final), we will extend the deadline by one week to give participants enough time to adjust their prompts.
